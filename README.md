# just-code
Just for recording some interesting and useful code.

To run a certain cpp file `./DIR/NAME.cpp`, at the dir of this repo, type:

    make ./DIR/NAME

The `Makefile` will compile the source file, generate the executable file and run it automatically.  
For example, to run `./src/test.cpp`:

    make ./src/test
